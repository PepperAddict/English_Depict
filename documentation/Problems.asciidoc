* Things I've learned. 

** Nginx 

When it comes to rendering the reactjs pages, make sure to have `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;` that way you won't get 404 when refreshing the page. 

Must have different location {} paths for api type endpoints. Since reactjs needs try_files, api endpoint needs it removed otherwise it'll be searching for a file or directory as discussed here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44668559/how-to-setup-routes-with-express-and-nginx

When hosting nginx on windows local setup, make sure to have nginx on a path that doesn't require running as administrator as nothing will be put in logs unless you run nginx as admin everytime. 

** Nodejs 

The big problem that I faced was using an unstable version of node which is version 14 at the time. Downgrade back to 12 if GraphQL hangs during queries. 

** GraphQL endpoint receives 400 bad request 

I received this problem with cors and without. Somehow removing mode: no-cors work as well as modifying the request in webpack, but I believe removing no-cors did the trick considering the graphql endpoint doesn't have cors enabled for it anymore.

** Webpack 

There was an issue with MIME type error after hosting it. I had to remove the hot reload option as discussed here:
