            <h2>Information we collect and its purpose: </h2>

            <p><strong>Teacher Account:</strong>
            Only an adult who classifies themselves as a teacher (could also be a parent/guardian) can create 
            a teacher's account. From there, teachers can create a student for accessing their tasks. The data required 
            for a teacher's account is a unique email, password, and a name. Email and password's only purpose is to pinpoint the 
            current user. Email's other purpose is for communication between our service as well as Amazon Alexa's service if the user 
            would like that feature. Username is for personalization purposes.</p>

            <p><strong>Student account:</strong> Only the teacher can create a student account. The required data for setting up a 
            student account is a unique username, secret question, and identifier animal. Please help your student finalize their account.
            The student would require the student's username and an answer to their secret qusetion
            that was supplied. From there, the student will be required to set their own personal password using images for a quicker login experience.
            Any personal information from the student is optional and entirely up to the parent or guardian monitoring the student's usage. </p>

            <p>The teacher account who created the student's account has full control of the student's account and full responsibility. The teacher can 
                delete, assign tasks, set a welcome message, transfer, and share student. Tasks submitted by student will be stored and 
                sent to the teacher to be approved. Teachers can permanently delete tasks from the internal service which cannot be 
                reversed.
            </p>
            <p>Other teachers with the shared student can assign tasks, but cannot delete or transfer student.</p>

            <h2>How we Use the Information We Collect: </h2>: 
            
            <p>We collect content that was submitted (ex: tasks, pictures, teacher messages, etc). 
                <ul>
                <li>Vocabulary: Students can submit vocabulary words to their own vocabulary bucket which will be sent to the teacher to use as a 
                word of the day for a later time. </li>
                <li>Tasks: Teachers are the ones that can create tasks for students. 
                    Anything submitted by the student is sent to their teacher to approve, reject, and/or delete. </li>
