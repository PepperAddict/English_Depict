            <h2>Information we collect and its purpose: </h2>

            <p><strong>Teacher Account:</strong>
            Only an adult who classifies themselves as a teacher (could also be a parent/guardian) can create 
            a teacher's account. From there they can create a student so they can access their tasks. The data required 
            for a teacher's account is a unique email, password, and a name. Email and password's only purpose is to pinpoint the 
            current user. Email's purpose is for communication between our service as well as Amazon Alexa's service if the user 
            would like that feature. Username/name is for personalization purposes. Whether you want to give your real name is 
            entirely up to the user. </p>
            
            <p>Through Amazon's login, your name, email, password will be automatically collected. </p>

            <p><strong>Student account:</strong> The required data for setting up a student account is a unique username, secret question, and identifier animal. 
            Please help your student to sign in for the first time as to finalize the account would require the student's username 
            that was supplied and an answer to the secret question. From there, the student will be required to set their own personal
            password using images for a quicker login experience.</p>

            <p>The teacher account who created the student's account has full control of their account. The teacher can 
                delete the student, assign tasks, set a welcome message, transfer student, and share.
            </p>
            <p>Other teachers with the shared student can assign tasks, set welcome message, for student but cannot delete or transfer student.</p>

            <p>The current purpose of the Identifier animal is for Amazon Alexa to pinpoint the correct student for your account.</p>

            <h2>How we Share the Information We Collect: </h2>: 
            
            <p>We collect content that was submitted (ex: tasks, pictures, messages, etc). Student's
